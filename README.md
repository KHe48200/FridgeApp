## Description

### Fridge App is a web application for keeping track of your groceries by allowing you to add/modify/remove items on your fridge and shopping list. 
This application works by moving products between fridge and shopping list based on their status (running out/run out/got it). This means that items appear where you need them to appear eg. run out products move from fridge to shopping list so you'll know you need to buy these.

Fridge app is built using:
* MonogoDB, a NoSQL database used to store all products
* Express.js, a web application framework that runs on Node.js
* Pug,  template engine for Node.js. [Pug Github page](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
* Node.js, an execution environment for event-driven server-side and networking applications.
